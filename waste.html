            <p class="z2">Improper waste management in Sri Lanka
                poses significant environmental and public health challenges.
                With rapid urbanization and population growth,
                the country grapples with inadequate infrastructure and
                enforcement mechanisms to handle its escalating waste generation.
                Many areas lack proper waste disposal facilities, leading to indiscriminate
                dumping in water bodies, open spaces, and along roadsides. This not only
                contaminates soil and water sources but also contributes to the proliferation of
                diseases. The absence of comprehensive recycling and composting programs further
                exacerbates the problem, as valuable resources are lost, and organic waste continues
                to burden landfills. Urgent action is required to invest in sustainable waste management
                solutions, including infrastructure development, public awareness campaigns, and policy reforms
                to mitigate the adverse impacts of improper waste disposal in Sri Lanka.</p>
