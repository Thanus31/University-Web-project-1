                <p class="w2">How amazing is this?
                    These peaceful waters mirror the colors of Sri Lanka’s
                    natural beauty. Nonetheless, something sinister is lurking below this calm
                    surface – water pollution. This pristine waterside is now plagued by pollution.
                    Sri Lanka is no longer qualified of sustaining its rivers to the coastal stretch from contamination.
                    Industrial emissions, agricultural run-offs, and improper waste disposal are the main contributors.
                    Pollutants have tainted the once-unspoiled water,
                    threatening sea life and the health of people who rely on it for sustenance.
                    The current environment disaster must be resolved to allow future can witness
                    the attractiveness of Sri Lanka’s waters without fearing pollution.</p>

            <h3>Below are some of the common ways of water pollution in Sri Lanka and their solutions.</h3>
            <p class="water">Water pollution in Sri Lanka arises from various sources, including industrial discharge, 
                agricultural runoff, and inadequate waste management systems. Industrial activities often 
                release harmful chemicals and heavy metals into water bodies, contaminating them and posing 
                serious risks to aquatic life and human health. Agricultural runoff carries pesticides, 
                fertilizers, and sediment into rivers and lakes, leading to eutrophication and the destruction of 
                aquatic ecosystems. Inadequate waste management results in untreated sewage being discharged into 
                waterways, spreading diseases and further deteriorating water quality. To combat these issues, strict 
                regulations must be enforced on industries to control their waste discharge, while promoting sustainable 
                agricultural practices to minimize chemical runoff. Additionally, investments in improved wastewater treatment 
                facilities and public awareness campaigns are crucial to address the inadequate waste management problem and 
                encourage responsible water usage among the population. By implementing these measures, Sri Lanka can mitigate 
                water pollution and safeguard its precious water resources for future generations.</p>
